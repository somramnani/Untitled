### Notes
- A social network would allow a limo business to create a profile and connect with either other limo companies or independent operators on   an as needed basis

- The idea behind it being social would operate on a few different levels:

    - Operators would have the ability to rate one another based on their experiences, both past and present.
    
     - Each company would have an “overall” score that would be built on several points -
        1. Profile completeness (providing insurance and        licensing certificates, actual fleet pictures etc. 
        2. A verified review of the profile 
        3. A local market rate sheet 
        4. Their overall rating with other operators - this would be a multi-point rating system that would involve ‘communication’,                  ‘payment promptness’, ‘client feedback (if any)’ etc.
        
     - The companies would be able to “friend” one another and send work back and forth via an integration with an existing technology in          our industry called ‘g-net’
     
     - Independent operators can sign up to get work and post their rates for work with vehicles etc.
     
     - Your visibility by city/market would be based on your profile and your overall score'
